## Content Guidelines

### Do's

✅ **Lead with customer outcomes**
"Reduce deployment time by 40%" not "Our platform has advanced CI/CD"

✅ **Use concrete examples**
"500+ enterprises trust us" not "Industry-leading solution"

✅ **Be honest about limitations**
"This works best for teams over 50 people" not overselling

✅ **Speak in the customer's language**
Use terms they use, not just our product names

✅ **Show, don't just tell**
Screenshots, demos, case studies over feature lists

✅ **Use active voice**
"Deploy in minutes" not "Deployments can be completed in minutes"

### Don'ts

❌ **Avoid superlatives without proof**
Not "the best," "revolutionary," "game-changing" without data

❌ **No buzzword bingo**
Minimize: synergy, paradigm, leverage, innovative (unless backed up)

❌ **Don't talk down to technical users**
Assume competence; explain without condescension

❌ **Avoid fear-mongering**
Don't sell on fear; focus on positive outcomes

❌ **No vague claims**
"Faster" needs a number; "Better" needs specifics

❌ **Don't ignore the competition**
Acknowledge alternatives exist; explain our advantages

## Writing Style

### Headlines
- Clear and benefit-driven
- 6-10 words ideal
- Active voice
- No puns or wordplay (save for occasional social media)
- Example: "Deploy enterprise software with confidence"

### Body Copy
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)
- One idea per paragraph
- Use subheadings liberally
- Bullet points for scanability
- Link to deeper content instead of cramming everything in

### Call-to-Actions
- Action-oriented verbs
- Specific about outcome
- Remove friction language
- Examples:
  - ✅ "Start free trial" (not "Sign up")
  - ✅ "See live demo" (not "Learn more")
  - ✅ "Talk to sales" (not "Contact us")
